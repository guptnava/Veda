This is a comprehensive React application that appears to be an AI-powered chatbot interface with data visualization capabilities, likely designed for interacting with a backend API to process queries, display results in tables or graphs, and provide configuration options. Below is a detailed preview of how this component would look and function when rendered in a browser, based on the provided code.

Preview of veda.jsx

General Layout
The veda.jsx component renders a full-screen, dark-themed chat interface with a fixed header, a collapsible left settings panel, a central chat area, and a fixed input form at the bottom. The UI is styled with a modern, professional look using inline CSS and Tailwind-inspired classes, with a color scheme featuring dark backgrounds (#1e1e1e, #252526), blue accents (#0e639c), and light text (#d4d4d4). The layout is responsive and uses flexbox for alignment.

Header: A fixed blue bar (#0e639c) at the top containing:

A hamburger menu button to toggle the left panel.
A placeholder logo (36x36 pixels) and the title "AI-Nova" in bold, white text.
Two dropdowns for selecting the AI model (e.g., llama3.2:1b, dbLLM) and interaction mode (e.g., direct, database).


Left Panel: A collapsible sidebar (288px wide when open) with settings for model parameters (temperature, topK, topP), toggles for showing filters, graphs, and downloads, and a command history section.
Main Chat Area: A scrollable area displaying messages, tables, and graphs, with smooth scrolling to the latest message.
Input Form: A fixed bottom bar with a textarea for user input and a "Send" button, disabled during loading.

Key Visual Elements

Header:

The header is fixed at the top, ensuring it remains visible while scrolling.
The hamburger menu animates into an "X" when the left panel is open, with smooth transitions.
Dropdowns for model and interaction mode are styled with dark backgrounds and white text, with a disabled state during API calls.


Left Panel:

When open, it displays:

Settings Section: Sliders for temperature (0–1), topK (1–100), and topP (0–1), with labels showing current values. A "Reset Sliders" button sets them to defaults (0.7, 50, 0.9).
Toggles: Three toggle switches for showing/hiding filters, graphs, and download buttons, styled with a sliding animation.
Command History: A list of up to 10 recent user commands, displayed as clickable buttons with truncated text for long commands. If empty, it shows "No history yet."


The panel collapses smoothly to 0 width when closed, with a border-right when open.


Chat Area:

Messages are displayed as speech bubbles:

User Messages: Green (#0a5a0a) background, aligned to the right, with rounded corners (except bottom-right).
Assistant Messages: Dark gray (#252526) background, aligned to the left, with rounded corners (except bottom-left). The first message (greeting) is styled differently for full width.


Each assistant message shows:

The model used (e.g., "Model: llama3.2:1b") in a small blue label at the top.
A "Copy" button (changes to "Copied!" for 2 seconds after clicking).
Response time (e.g., "Response time: 2.34s") in small, italicized text.


Markdown content is rendered with react-markdown and remark-gfm, supporting tables and code blocks with syntax highlighting (using react-syntax-highlighter with the oneDark theme).
Streaming messages (while the API is responding) are displayed in real-time, updating as new tokens arrive.


Table and Graph Display:

Table: When a message contains tableData, a responsive table is shown with:

Headers in blue (#0e639c) with white text.
Up to 10 rows of data, with object values stringified (e.g., {"key": "value"}).
A horizontal scrollbar for wide tables, styled with a thin blue thumb.
A note indicating the number of rows shown and that full data is available for download.


Graph Options: Below the table, a control panel allows:

Filters: Dynamic filter rows with dropdowns for column, operator (equals, not equals, contains, etc.), and a text input for values. Buttons to add/remove filters and apply them.
Graph Settings: Dropdowns for graph type (bar or line), X-axis, Y-axis, and aggregation (count, sum, average, min, max). A "Generate Graph" button creates the visualization.
View Toggle: A button to switch between table and graph views.
Download Options: Buttons for downloading the table as Excel, CSV, or PDF, each with an icon.


Graphs:

Bar Graph: Displays bars with heights proportional to data values, colored in teal (rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.6)). Labels show at the top of each bar, and the X-axis shows truncated labels.
Line Graph: An SVG path draws the line, with circular points at data points and labels above them. The Y-axis shows three values (max, half-max, 0).
Both graphs have a dark background (#2d2d2d), a title, and a note indicating they were generated from fetched data.
A "Save Graph" button downloads bar graphs as PNG and line graphs as SVG.




Input Form:

A textarea (monospace font, resizable vertically) for user input, with a placeholder "Ask me.........".
A "Send" button with a gradient background, disabled during loading with a "Loading..." label.
Pressing Enter (without Shift) sends the message, while Shift+Enter allows newlines.



Interactive Behavior

Sending Messages: Users type in the textarea and click "Send" or press Enter. The message appears as a user bubble, and the assistant responds with streamed content or table data, depending on the interaction mode.
Streaming: Assistant responses stream in real-time, updating the UI as new tokens or data arrive.
Settings: The left panel allows adjusting model parameters, toggling UI elements, and revisiting past commands, which auto-fill the input and restore the model/mode.
Data Visualization:

Users can filter table data dynamically and apply filters to update the displayed table.
Graphs are generated based on selected columns and aggregation, with smooth transitions for bar heights.
Downloads (Excel, CSV, PDF) and graph saving (PNG/SVG) are triggered via API calls.


Accessibility: The UI includes ARIA labels for buttons, dropdowns, and messages, ensuring screen reader compatibility.

Example Scenario

The app loads with a greeting message ("Good morning! What can I help you with today?") in the chat area.
The user selects database mode and llama3.2:1b model, enters a query like "Show sales data for 2025", and clicks "Send".
A streaming message appears, showing a table with sales data (e.g., columns: Date, Region, Amount). The table shows 10 rows, with options to filter (e.g., "Region equals North"), generate a bar graph (e.g., Amount by Region), or download the data.
The user generates a bar graph, toggles to view it, and saves it as a PNG. They then add a filter and apply it to update the table.

Visual Style
The UI is sleek and modern, resembling a code editor (e.g., VS Code) with its dark theme, blue accents, and clean typography (Inter, sans-serif). Scrollbars are thin and blue, buttons have hover effects with shadows and scaling, and graphs use teal for data visualization. The overall aesthetic is professional, suitable for a data-driven application.

Notes

Dependencies: The code relies on react, react-markdown, remark-gfm, react-syntax-highlighter, lucide-react, and html-to-image. Ensure these are installed in the project.
API Integration: The app assumes a backend API at /api/generate, /api/download-excel, etc., which must be implemented separately.
Potential Improvements:

Add loading spinners for graph generation or downloads.
Handle edge cases (e.g., very large datasets, empty responses).
Improve mobile responsiveness (e.g., stack header dropdowns, adjust panel width).


Chart Rendering: The code uses custom BarGraphComponent and LineGraphComponent instead of Chart.js, so no Chart.js charts are generated despite the instruction to use it for charts. If you want Chart.js-based charts, please specify, and I can provide a modified version.
